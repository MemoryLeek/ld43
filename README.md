# Ludum Dare #43 (Jam)
Go to https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/pixel-rot for a full description of the game.

## Compiling the source
The following libraries are required to build this game.
- [SFML 2](http://www.sfml-dev.org/)
- [tmxlite](https://github.com/fallahn/tmxlite)

Since we both used Qt Creator we went with the default .pro/qmake build system, so `qmake` is required, even though we didn't use Qt itself.
